In this project, I try to teach people about some of the sections in Geomerty Lesson. 

There are seven sections in this app. (Contents are Turkish) 

These are:

* Deltoid (Deltoid)
* Rectangles (Dikdörtgenler)
* Quadrilaterals (Dörtgenler), 
* Rhombuses (Eşkenar Dörtgenler), 
* Square (Kare), 
* Parallelogram (Paralelkenar) 
* Trapezoid (Yamuk).

For these sections, there are three type of contents. These are documents (PDF), videos (MP4) and tests (SWF).

## Tools That I Used During Development

In this project, I used COM Components before, but when I try this application nowadays SWF files cause crash. So I changed the display method of all content types. Instead of using COM Components, I used three app to display contents. These are Media Player Classic Portable, Adobe Flash Player Portable and Sumatra Pdf Portable. I embeded these portable app's window when they are called in application. <br>

* Visual Studio Community Edition 2022 (as a code editor)
* Media Player Classic Portable (To Play Video Files)
* Adobe Flash Player Portable (To Play Flash Files)
* Sumatra Pdf Portable (To View Pdf Files)
* Gimp & Power Point (To create some ui images)
* Vectezy and Flaticon (To add some ui icons and images)
